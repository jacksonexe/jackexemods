This requires the most recent version of the cyberpunk engine tweaks mod framework: https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks/releases/tag/v1.21.0
Once installed, you can change the seed using the seed variable in the init.lua

WARNING: This mod doesn't work for Johnny's memories or braindances. You need to disable the mod before these sections. To do so, set the Enabled variable in the init.lua to false then restart the game. Once done with the section, you can reenable the mod and restart the game again.

DISCLAIMER: I do not intend to support this mod, if there are minor changes people want then thats fine but any big features I will not be making.

ATTRIBUTION: If you do use this mod for any content or make changes please attribute the original mod.

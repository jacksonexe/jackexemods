This requires the most recent version of the cyberpunk engine tweaks mod framework: https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks/releases/tag/v1.21.0
Once installed, just drag the bin folder into the root of your cyberpunk 2077 game files. To add or remove weapons, you can edit the weapons.txt
Make sure to bind both Start Chaos Engine and Toggle Lava so you can enable the chaos
NOTE: if you leave lava toggled on when reloading a save in Pacifica, the game will crash.
